# AI / Spec-Driven Book Creation Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy and correctness of all technical content
All technical information, code examples, and explanations must be factually accurate and technically correct. No hallucinated tools, features, or capabilities should be presented as real.

### Clear, structured writing for beginner–to–intermediate developers
Content must be written with a simple, professional instructional tone that is accessible to developers with varying levels of experience. Structure should be logical and consistent throughout the book.

### Strict spec-driven workflow using Spec-Kit Plus
All development must follow the spec-driven process using Spec-Kit Plus conventions (/sp.plan, /sp.write, etc.). Every feature and chapter must be planned before implementation.

### Practical, real-world examples
All concepts must be demonstrated with practical, real-world examples that readers can apply in their own work. Examples must be correct and reproducible.

### Responsible and effective use of AI tools
AI tools should be leveraged effectively to enhance productivity and quality while maintaining human oversight and responsibility for the final output.

## Standards

- No hallucinated tools or features
- Original, plagiarism-free content
- Consistent terminology and structure
- Code examples must be correct and reproducible
- Prefer official documentation where references are needed

## Constraints

- Written in Markdown / MDX for Docusaurus
- Uses Spec-Kit Plus conventions (/sp.plan, /sp.write, etc.)
- Deployed to GitHub Pages
- Simple, professional instructional tone

## Success Criteria

- Complete book follows spec-driven process
- Content builds and renders correctly in Docusaurus
- Successfully deployed on GitHub Pages
- Clear learning value in every chapter

## Governance

This constitution governs all aspects of the AI / Spec-Driven Book Creation project. All development practices, code reviews, and project decisions must align with these principles. Amendments to this constitution require documentation of the changes, approval from project maintainers, and a migration plan for existing content.
